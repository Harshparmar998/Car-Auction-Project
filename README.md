## üîç Image Validation
This project originally uses **Google Cloud Vision API** for OCR validation.  
For open-source purposes, a **mock OCR service** is included (`utils/visionMock.js`) so the project can run without paid API keys.

If you want to integrate real OCR:
1. Enable Google Vision API on Google Cloud.
2. Replace `validateImageMock` with `@google-cloud/vision` client.
3. Add your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` key file.
